    <h2>My Favorite Character:</h2>
    <h1>Iron Man!!!</h1>
    <p1> Tony Stark A.K.A Iron Man is a super-smart, super hero, billionare! He is a super hero who is wildly known as "Iron Man"! But dont be fooled, his real name isn't Tony Stark or Iron Man, it is Robert Downey Jr. who is an amazing actor that has also acted in many  films and shows! These are some fun facts about Tony Stark A.K.A Iron Man: Iron Man possesses a wealth of powers through his powered armor suit. These powers include super strength, the ability to fly, durability, and a number of weapons. The primary weapons used by Iron Man are rays that are shot from the palms of his gauntlets, His dependence on technology is one of his biggest weaknesses. Without all of his high-tech objects, Stark wouldn't even be alive. He has always depended on the arc reactor in his chest, and in Iron Man, audiences saw how unstable he could be when it wasn't working when Pepper had to help change the reactor, and Tony's sacrificial snap instantly sends a fatal wave of gamma energy through his body, frying his right side and rendering him unable to even really speak. He dies on the battlefield with his wife, Pepper, and protégé, Peter Parker, at his side. One day a movie called Avengers Endgame came out and in that film, unfortunatly, Iron Man died, but not in real life! His contract was ending and he had to resign it but Robbert Downey Jr. didn't want to play the role of Iron Man or Tony Stark anymore, so they had to die off his character never to be seen alive again. Iron Man, Tony Stark, Or Robbert Downey Jr. is an amazing super hero, person with 270 IQ, billion that I love and may others too!</p1>
